# MindTrackr - Bad POC

## 🎯 Goal
Create a non-polished version that has UI, logic, performance, and code-quality issues. This version will later be "fixed" using improved development practices.

## 📋 Project Overview

**App Name:** MindTrackr  
**Concept:** A Mental Health Journal with Mood Tracking  
**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Chart.js + LocalStorage  

### ✨ Features

- Add a daily journal entry with a selected mood (Happy, Sad, Stressed, Calm, etc.)
- View weekly/monthly mood trends with Chart.js
- Filter entries by mood
- Responsive and accessible layout

### 🔧 App Components

The app should have:

- A text area for the journal entry
- A dropdown to select mood (Happy, Sad, Stressed, Calm, etc.)
- A button to "Save" the entry to localStorage
- A chart showing mood frequency using Chart.js

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This is intentionally a **bad implementation** with the following characteristics:

- ❌ No focus on design or structure; just functional
- ❌ CSS isn't consistent or responsive
- ❌ No modular code structure; everything in one file if needed
- ❌ No state management library or hooks optimization
- ❌ Uses inline CSS and repetitive code
- ❌ No input validation or accessibility focus
- ❌ Lacks polish and maintainability

> **Note:** This serves as the bad baseline app that will be improved in subsequent iterations.
